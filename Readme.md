Highlights:

- Requirements seemed to request that the search response be distinct from the detail call, and that both calls should be made. This adds a non-trivial amount of complexity, so some design choices were made to balence supporting the pretend-nature of it, while still delivering an example of a reasonable service object with 2 calls and 2 models. 
- Sourceing final images and getting to a pixel-perfect match to the comp was a little out of scope for my timeline. Please accept my humble apologies at the less-awesome vanilla assets and deviations.
- I opted to use combine where it made sense, but it is pretty new to me, so it may not be the prettiest and use all the features.
- There's no keyboard avoidance since i assume we will be using the simulator.
